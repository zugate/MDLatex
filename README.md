## Usage

### Basic Usage
Render Markdown with embedded LaTeX expressions:

```swift
import MDLatex

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var renderingComplete = false
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if renderingComplete {
                Text("Rendering Complete!")
                    .font(.headline)
                    .padding()
            }

            MDLatex.render(
                markdown: """
                # Title
                This is some inline math: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\).

                And a display equation:
                \[
                E = mc^2
                \]
                """,
                theme: ThemeConfiguration(
                    backgroundColor: Color.clear,
                    fontColor: Color.black,
                    fontSize: 16,
                    fontFamily: "Arial",
                    userInteractionEnabled: true
                ),
                animation: AnimationConfiguration(isEnabled: true, chunkRenderingDuration: 0.4),
                width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width - 32,
                onComplete: { _ in
                    /// to do on complete rendering 
                },
                onChunkRendered: { _, _ in
                    /// to do on chunk rendered
                }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### Customizing the Theme
Configure the theme using the fluent API:

```swift
MDLatex.render(
    markdown: "# Custom Theme Example",
    theme: ThemeConfiguration(
        backgroundColor: .blue,
        fontColor: .white,
        fontSize: 20,
        fontFamily: "Helvetica",
        userInteractionEnabled: true
    ),
    animation: AnimationConfiguration(isEnabled: false),
    width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width - 32
)
```

---

### Animating Content
Enable chunk-based animations for rendering large content:

```swift
MDLatex.render(
    markdown: """
    # Animated Content Example
    Chunk 1...

    Chunk 2...

    Chunk 3...
    """,
    theme: ThemeConfiguration(
        backgroundColor: .white,
        fontColor: .black,
        fontSize: 16,
        fontFamily: "Arial"
    ),
    animation: AnimationConfiguration(isEnabled: true, chunkRenderingDuration: 0.3)
    )
```

Use `onChunkRendered` and `onComplete` for callbacks:

```swift
MDLatex.render(
    markdown: """
    # Animated Content Example
    Chunk 1...

    Chunk 2...

    Chunk 3...
    """,
        .onChunkRendered { chunk, index in
        print("Rendered chunk \(index): \(chunk)")
    }
    .onComplete { finalHTML in
        print("Rendering complete: \(finalHTML)")
    }
)    
```

### Caching Content
Take advantage of caching in non-animated mode:

It by default caches the contents once rendered so you wont see a rerendering jitter


---

## How It Works

1. **Markdown Parsing:** Uses [Down](https://github.com/johnxnguyen/Down) to convert Markdown into HTML.
2. **LaTeX Handling:** Extracts LaTeX expressions with a custom parser and injects them into the HTML using KaTeX.
3. **Dynamic Rendering:** Supports chunk-based or one-go rendering, depending on the animation configuration.
4. **WebView Integration:** Leverages `WKWebView` for rendering HTML and JavaScript for KaTeX rendering.

---

## Architecture

- **`AnimationConfiguration`:** Defines animation settings like duration and toggle for enabling animations.
- **`ThemeConfiguration`:** Handles theme properties like colors, font size, and font family.
- **`MarkdownLatexView`:** The main SwiftUI view for rendering Markdown and LaTeX.
- **`MarkdownLatexParser`:** A utility for extracting and reinjecting LaTeX expressions into HTML.
- **`katex_template.html`:** A prebuilt HTML template for KaTeX rendering.
